# FBLA-2021-Coding-and-Programming

This is my project for 2021 FBLA Coding and Programming for Nationals. 

It is a website which has a 5-question quiz with four types of questions: multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and dropdown. The quiz consists of FBLA questions from objective tests from various different FBLA events. The quiz has no time limit but it will be timed to see how long it took you to complete the test. If you haven't answered any of the questions, an alert will pop up warning you that you didn't answer however many questions and if you are sure you want to submit the quiz. 

After you submit the quiz, you can see your score and all the questions, what you answered, and what the correct answer was. You can also see how long it took you to complete the test, previous test scores and time taken, and a graph showing accuracy and time taken over time. You can also print your quiz results. 

You can also see the database of all the possible questions on the quiz. There are 20 multiple choice questions, 10 true/false questions, 10 fill-in-the-blank questions, and 10 dropdown questions, for a total of 50 possible questions. On the database page, you can also see all the answer choices and the correct answer to the question. 

There are also many interactive features which make the website convenient and easy to use for you, the user. For example, there is an interactive Q&A with an AI chatbot, a FAQ page, a navbar at the top, a popup help menu, and a Google Translate feature which translates the webpage into any language so that people all over the world can use the website. 

This project was created using Flask with Python. Programming languages used were Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL. The questions database is stored in a SQlite3 database and has a dynamic backup feature using a Sqlite backup API in case the original database gets altered or corrupted.
